Hackathon - Reinforcement Learning - Deep Q Learning - Soccer Bot

Developed env/gym in python to train bot.

Used a Deep Q Learning algorithm to train the Agent in this env.

The Agent learns through multiple episodes how to solve the environment

Number of Goals ![alt text](/docs/TrainingCurve.png)
                         Number of episodes. 

Training Curve - Number of times Agent is able to get the ball to the goal (reward) in every 50 episodes  

As we can see eventually the Agent is able to learn a Policy that is able to take the goal to the ball in each episode reliably


Then OpenCV is used to identify these objects through a fixed camera. This input is given to the arduino robot that moves an object to a goal.
